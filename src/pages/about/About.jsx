 <Link to="/about" style={{color:"red",fontWeight: 'bold' }}><h1>Our Story</h1></Link> 
 <p>At TAX Servicez, we are proud to have started our firm in the face of adversity. Like many others, we were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns. As employees were being laid off and businesses were shutting down, we found ourselves in a difficult situation.</p>

 <p>However, we refused to let these challenges hold us back. Instead, we saw an opportunity to create something new and innovative. We decided to start our own firm, with the mission of providing high-quality financial services to clients in a different way.</p>

 <p>We started from zero, with nothing to lose, and worked tirelessly to build our reputation and earn the trust of our clients. Today, we are proud to say that we have succeeded in our mission. People have started recognizing us, and we are grateful for their support and trust.</p>

 <p>We have kept the cost of our services low, so that there is little load on our clients. We understand that financial management can be a significant expense, and we believe that everyone should have access to high-quality services at an affordable price. That's why we are committed to providing our clients with the best value for their money.</p>

 <p> At TAX Servicez, we are passionate about what we do, and we are committed to serving our clients with honesty, integrity, and professionalism. We are grateful for the opportunity to make a positive impact in the lives of our clients, and we look forward to continuing to serve them for years to come.</p>
